# Holberton School Low level programming repository

This repository contains the projects for Holberton School low level programming, which centers around working with some algorithms using C as the main programming language. It contains from the basics in C (print the first Hello world, variables, conditionals, loops, etc) to building more complex programs using structures, memory allocation and more. For more info about each project, check its README.

### Tech

This repository is written mostly (if not entirely in C).

### Installation

Each repository contains the source file for each task in the project. Usually each task requires a main and the code we need to develop. After you use a git clone to this repository and navigate to the desired directory, you can compile the task you need using gcc and its options, the name of the files to compile and the name of the output file. For example, if you need the first task: 
```sh
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-nameofthefirsttask.c -o nameoftheoutputfile
```
